waffle
===

`waffle` is a Lua execution environment, meant to be batteries-included.

The "twist" is that this isn't PUC Lua, it's backed by [gopher-lua][1].


Why?
===

Go's stdlib is comprehensive and I'm used to gopher-lua after using it in
several projects.

There's no design goal other than having fun.
